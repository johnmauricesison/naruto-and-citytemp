# 📊 Data Analysis and Visualization using Python Pandas and HVPLOT

## 📝 Program Description
This project demonstrates how to perform **data analysis** and **data visualization** using Python.  
It includes two Jupyter Notebook programs:

1. **Naruto.ipynb** — performs **data analysis** using **Pandas**  
2. **City Temperature.ipynb** — performs **data visualization** using **HVPLOT**

By combining Pandas and HVPLOT, this project provides a complete workflow:  
from analyzing and cleaning data to visualizing results through interactive charts.
